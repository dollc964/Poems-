      <h2>To Helen</h2>
      <p>
        Helen, thy beauty is to me
            Like those Nicean barks of yore,
            That gently, oer a perfumed sea,
            The weary, way-worn wanderer bore
            To his own native shore. - Edgar Allen Poe

      <h3>Au Lecteur</h3>
      <p>
        Folly and error, stinginess and sin
Possess our spirits and fatigue our flesh.
And like a pet we feed our tame and remorse
As beggars take to nourishing their lice.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our songs are stubborn, our contrition lax;
We offer lavishly our vows of faith
And turn back gladly to the path of filth,
Thinking mean tears will wash away our stains.
      </p>
      <p>
        On evils pillow lies the alchemist
Satan thrice-great, who lulls our captive soul,
And all the richest metal of our will
Is vaporized by his hermetic arts.
      </p>
      <p>
        Truly the devil pulls on all our strings
      </p>

      <h4>On Anothers Sorrow</h3>
      <p>
        Can I see another's woe,
And not be in sorrow too?
Can I see another's grief,
And not seek for kind relief?
      </p>
      <p>
        Can I see a falling tear,
And not feel my sorrow's share?
Can a father see his child
Weep, nor be with sorrow filled?
      </p>
      <p>
        Can a mother sit and hear
An infant groan, an infant fear?
No, no!  never can it be!
Never, never can it be!
And can He who smiles on all
Hear the wren with sorrows small,
      </p>
      <p>
        Hear the small bird's grief and care,
Hear the woes that infants bear --
      </p>
      <p>
        And not sit beside the next,
Pouring pity in their breast,
And not sit the cradle near,
Weeping tear on infant's tear?
      </p>
      <p>
        And not sit both night and day,
Wiping all our tears away?
Oh no! never can it be!
Never, never can it be!
He doth give his joy to all:
He becomes an infant small,
He becomes a man of woe,
He doth feel the sorrow too.
      </p>
      <p>
        Think not thou canst sigh a sigh,
And thy Maker is not by:
Think not thou canst weep a tear,
And thy Maker is not near.
      </p>
      <p>
        Oh He gives to us his joy,
That our grief He may destroy:
Till our grief is fled an gone
He doth sit by us and moan.

      <h5>Alone</h4>
        <p>
        From childhood’s hour I have not been
As others were—I have not seen
As others saw—I could not bring
My passions from a common spring—
From the same source I have not taken
My sorrow—I could not awaken
My heart to joy at the same tone—
And all I lov’d—I lov’d alone—
Then—in my childhood—in the dawn
Of a most stormy life—was drawn
From ev’ry depth of good and ill
The mystery which binds me still—
From the torrent, or the fountain—
From the red cliff of the mountain—
From the sun that ’round me roll’d
In its autumn tint of gold—
From the lightning in the sky
As it pass’d me flying by—
From the thunder, and the storm—
And the cloud that took the form
(When the rest of Heaven was blue)
Of a demon in my view—
