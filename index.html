      <h2>To Helen</h2>
      <p>
        Helen, thy beauty is to me
        <br>
            Like those Nicean barks of yore,
            <br>
            That gently, oer a perfumed sea,
            <br>
            The weary, way-worn wanderer bore
            <br>
            To his own native shore. - Edgar Allen Poe

      <h3>Au Lecteur</h3>
      <p>
        Folly and error, stinginess and sin
Possess our spirits and fatigue our flesh.
<br>
And like a pet we feed our tame and remorse
As beggars take to nourishing their lice.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our songs are stubborn, our contrition lax;
        <br>
We offer lavishly our vows of faith
<br>
And turn back gladly to the path of filth,
<br>
Thinking mean tears will wash away our stains.
      </p>
      <p>
        On evils pillow lies the alchemist
        <br>
Satan thrice-great, who lulls our captive soul,
<br>
And all the richest metal of our will
<br>
Is vaporized by his hermetic arts.
      </p>
      <p>
        Truly the devil pulls on all our strings -  Baudelair

      <h4>On Anothers Sorrow</h3>
      <p>
        Can I see another's woe,
        <br>
And not be in sorrow too?
<br>
Can I see another's grief,
<br>
And not seek for kind relief?
      </p>
      <p>
        Can I see a falling tear,
        <br>
And not feel my sorrow's share?
<br>
Can a father see his child
<br>
Weep, nor be with sorrow filled?
      </p>
      <p>
        Can a mother sit and hear
        <br>
An infant groan, an infant fear?
<br>
No, no!  never can it be!
<br>
Never, never can it be!
<br>
And can He who smiles on all
<br>
Hear the wren with sorrows small,
      </p>
      <p>
        Hear the small bird's grief and care,
        <br>
Hear the woes that infants bear --
      </p>
      <p>
        And not sit beside the next,
        <br>
Pouring pity in their breast,
<br>
And not sit the cradle near,
<br>
Weeping tear on infant's tear?
      </p>
      <p>
        And not sit both night and day,
        <br>
Wiping all our tears away?
<br>
Oh no! never can it be!
<br>
Never, never can it be!
<br>
He doth give his joy to all:
<br>
He becomes an infant small,
<br>
He becomes a man of woe,
<br>
He doth feel the sorrow too.
      </p>
      <p>
        Think not thou canst sigh a sigh,
        <br>
And thy Maker is not by:
<br>
Think not thou canst weep a tear,
<br>
And thy Maker is not near.
      </p>
      <p>
        Oh He gives to us his joy,
        <br>
That our grief He may destroy:
<br>
Till our grief is fled an gone
<br>
He doth sit by us and moan. - William Blake

      <h5>Alone</h4>
        <p>
        From childhoods hour I have not been
        <br>
As others were, I have not seen
<br>
As others saw, I could not bring
<br>
My passions from a common spring
<br>
From the same source I have not taken
<br>
My sorrow, I could not awaken
<br>
My heart to joy at the same tone
<br>
And all I lovd, I lovd alone
<br>
Then, in my childhood, in the dawn
<br>
Of a most stormy life, was drawn
<br>
From evry depth of good and ill
<br>
The mystery which binds me still
<br>
From the torrent, or the fountain
<br>
From the red cliff of the mountain
<br>
From the sun that round me rolld
<br>
In its autumn tint of gold
<br>
From the lightning in the sky
<br>
As it passd me flying by
<br>
From the thunder, and the storm
<br>
And the cloud that took the form
<br>
(When the rest of Heaven was blue)
<br>
Of a demon in my view - Edgar Allen Poe
