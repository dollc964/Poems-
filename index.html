      <h2>To Helen</h2>
      <p>
        Helen, thy beauty is to me
Like those Nicéan barks of yore,
That gently, o’er a perfumed sea,
The weary, way-worn wanderer bore
To his own native shore. - Edgar Allen Poe

      <h3>Au Lecteur</h3>
      <p>
        Folly and error, stinginess and sin
Possess our spirits and fatigue our flesh.
And like a pet we feed our tame and remorse
As beggars take to nourishing their lice.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our songs are stubborn, our contrition lax;
We offer lavishly our vows of faith
And turn back gladly to the path of filth,
Thinking mean tears will wash away our stains.
      </p>
      <p>
        On evils pillow lies the alchemist
Satan thrice-great, who lulls our captive soul,
And all the richest metal of our will
Is vaporized by his hermetic arts.
      </p>
      <p>
        Truly the devil pulls on all our strings
      </p>
